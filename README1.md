# sense-hat-games

This repository contains a collection of games for the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT addon. These games are designed to be played with the joystick on the Sense HAT (and possibly the accelerometer in the future), and enjoyed in full 8x8 resolution on the LED matrix. 

The code is designed to be as easy as possible for even a beginner (like myself at this point) to understand, with detailed comments explaining how it works. The only dependencies in these programs are common modules such as the SenseHat module, time, random and so on. Each file is otherwise independent - you should be able to download and run each separate file without needing to download extra modules or clone the entire repository. 

Finally, I made these games as a learning exercise - to get some experience using Python, designing games, working with specialised hardware and libraries and so on. And I wanted to share this code so that others, too, could learn something new. Feel free to download them, play them, modify them, use them as teaching material (I would be flattered) and even republish them. All I ask is that if you republish them, just give others the same rights to download, modify and republish, so it can continue on it's mission as an educational tool.
