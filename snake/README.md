The classic Snake game (as my dad pointed out, it really should be called Python). Use the joystick to move the snake (blue stripes) up, down, left and right. If you go beyond one edge of the screen, you reappear from the other end. If you eat an apple (red dot), you speed up, the snake grows, and you gain one point. If you eat yourself, that is, if your snake's head touches the snake's body, the game ends and your score is displayed.
